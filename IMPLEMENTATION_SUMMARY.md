# Implementation Summary

## Project: Ensemble Learning - Bagging and Boosting

### Completed Tasks ✓

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created organized directory structure (src/, tests/, examples/, data/)
   - Set up Python package with proper __init__.py files
   - Added .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files

2. **Core Implementations**
   - **Bagging Classifier**: Bootstrap aggregating with decision stumps
   - **AdaBoost Classifier**: Adaptive boosting with weighted samples
   - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Gradient descent-based boosting with regression trees
   - **Base Estimators**: Decision stumps and simple regression trees
   - **Utility Functions**: Data generation, train/test split, metrics computation

3. **Testing Suite**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all algorithms
   - Test coverage for fit, predict, and score methods
   - Performance validation tests
   - All tests pass with 100% success rate

4. **Examples and Documentation**
   - demo.py: Basic usage demonstration
   - comparison.py: Performance comparison across datasets
   - Comprehensive README.md with usage examples
   - Inline documentation and docstrings

5. **Dependencies**
   - requirements.txt with minimal dependencies (numpy, scikit-learn)
   - All dependencies installed and verified

### Test Results

**All Tests Passed:**
- ✓ Bagging fit, predict, score, and performance tests
- ✓ AdaBoost fit, predict, score, and performance tests
